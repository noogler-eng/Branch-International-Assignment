# Docker Compose configuration for the Dummy Branch App
# This setup includes a PostgreSQL database, a Flask API server, an Nginx reverse proxy,
# and Prometheus for monitoring.

# Use environment variables to configure ports, resource limits, and other settings.
# Example environment variables:
# POSTGRES_USER=branch_user
# POSTGRES_PASSWORD=branch_password
# POSTGRES_DB=branch_db
# FLASK_ENV=development
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://branch_user:branch_password@db:5432/branch_db
# LOG_LEVEL=info
# DB_PORT=5432
# API_PORT=8000
# NGINX_PORT=443
# DB_MEMORY_LIMIT=512M
# DB_CPU_LIMIT=0.5
# GUNICORN_WORKERS=2  

# version of Docker Compose file format
# Use version 3.9 for compatibility with the latest features
version: "3.9"

# Define the services that make up the application (DB, API, Nginx, Prometheus)
# Each service is configured with its image, environment variables, ports, volumes, and dependencies.
